# HLT Project
This project focuses on classifying the sentiment of movie reviews (positive or negative) using deep learning techniques. Three models are compared to evaluate their performance on this task:

- A plain Neural Network (NN)

- A Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM)

- A Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM)
